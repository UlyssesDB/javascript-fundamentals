For each of the following expressions:
 - Does it have a syntax error?
 - If it doesn't have a syntax error, what are the probable input and output types of the function?

a) x => x + 1
// no, should output x+1

b) x, y => x * y
// syntax error, x,y should be in parentheses

c) x => { x * 2 }
// syntax error, return should be wrapped in parentheses
// i was wrong, it works ???

d) (x, z) => {console.log(z); return x * z}
// syntax error, two statements
// i was wrong, it works ???

e) x => console.log(z); return x * z
// syntax error, two statements

f) (x) => x * 2
// no, should output x*2

e) () => console.log("hello")
// no, should output "hello"
